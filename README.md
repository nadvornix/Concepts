# Implementations of network flow:

It is possible to solve this as an integer linear programming problem. That may be a more general approach.

# Installation:

```
sudo apt install python-pydot python-pydot-ng graphviz libgraphviz-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# TODO:
- invent better name

# my notes::
- see how alg works (and is running)
- design user interface
- design server architecture
- put it all together

- design an algorithm w/ more features (multiple rounds ...)

- refactor code, make it pep compliant, write tests, make nice git repo

constraints:
- nejsou skupiny o jednoom člověku
